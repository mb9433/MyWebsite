<h1> Extinct Animals</h1>

  <h2> Dodo </h2>

  <p> Dodo birds are flightless birds which means that they cant fly. <br>
    Dodos were really big birds, they were around 3 feet tall <br>
    and could reach a body weight of 20 kg or even more! <br>
    Their diet mostly consisted of fruits, nuts and seeds.<br>
  It has also been suggested that they might have also been<br>
   eating shellfish and crabs.</p>

<h2> Ground Sloth </h2>

<p> Ground sloths are like really big sloths and they have been extinct<br>
for about 11 thousand years! Ground sloths could also sand up just on<br>
their two legs in order to reach the high branches. Ground sloths could<br>
also run at about 1.68 meters per second and 3.7 miles per hour, this is<br>
around the average walking speed for humans which explains why they might<br>
be easy prey. Ground sloths were actually herbivores and they ate cacti,<br>
yucca, desert globemallow and joshua tree fruits, along with other plants.</p>

<h2>Wooly Mammoth</h2>

  <p>Wooly mammoths look really scary and they look like they would eat humans,<br>
  but they are actually herbivores and they eat plants. They have been extinct <br>
  for about 4000 years. They lived in tundra steppe, here it went from Northern Asia<br>
  to many parts of Europe and North America. Woolly Mammoths were about 3-4 meters<br>
  which is definitely not as huge as most people think it is. They weighed at an <br> 
  average of 7,300 kg which is really heavy concidering they are only 3-4 meters tall.</p>
