  <h2> Dodo </h2>

  <p> Dodo birds are flightless birds which means that they cant fly. <br>
    Dodos were really big birds, they were around 3 feet tall <br>
    and could reach a body weight of 20 kg or even more! <br>
    Their diet mostly consisted of fruits, nuts and seeds.<br>
  It has also been suggested that they might have also been<br>
   eating shellfish and crabs.</p>
